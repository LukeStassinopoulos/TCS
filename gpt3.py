# Proposed script by chatgpt to handle errors from gpt2.py

# Key Updates:
# Matrix Multiplication Shapes: Added shape compatibility checks to avoid invalid operations.
# Error Handling: Improved error handling to better log issues with tensor shapes and operations.
# Neural Network Layers: Ensured forward passes handle potential shape mismatches.

#No errors yipee

#Chat gpt said this

#Summary of the Results:
# Tensor Creation:

# Tensors with shapes such as (7, 6), (68, 43, 99), (9, 0), and (4, 3, 10, 4) were created successfully.
# Tensor creation with an invalid shape (0, 0, 2) was attempted but didn't raise an error in this context.
# Tensor Operations:

# Indexing and slicing operations worked as expected, with valid outputs.
# Neural Network Layers:

# No exceptions were reported, indicating that the neural network layer creation and forward passes worked correctly.
# Autograd:

# No exceptions were reported, suggesting that gradient computations were handled correctly.
# Optimizer Steps:

# No exceptions were reported, implying that optimizer steps were executed correctly.
# Loss Functions:

# No exceptions were reported, indicating that loss function computations were successful.
# Exception Handling:

# No exceptions were raised during tensor creation with NaN shapes and Inf values, suggesting the current code doesn't attempt to handle these scenarios explicitly.
# Next Steps:
# Enhance Error Reporting:

# If the tensor creation with invalid shapes should raise an exception, ensure the script includes checks or validations for such cases. This is particularly important if using shapes that PyTorch handles gracefully but are still not ideal for your application.
# Increase Coverage:

# Extend the script to cover more edge cases or less common operations, including:
# Advanced tensor operations: Operations involving higher-dimensional tensors or complex slicing.
# Mixed Precision Training: Testing with torch.float16 or other data types to ensure proper handling.
# Distributed Training: If applicable, test distributed training setups to handle multi-GPU or multi-node configurations.
# Exception Handling:

# Implement explicit exception handling for known issues like invalid tensor shapes, NaNs, and Infs to ensure the script catches and reports these issues. Example:
# python
# Copy code
# try:
#     tensor = torch.randn((float('nan'), 10))  # Invalid shape
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Exception occurred with NaN shape: {e}")
# Add More Complex Tests:

# Model Training: Include tests for training a model, checking not just forward passes but also backward passes and optimization.
# Custom Layers and Loss Functions: Test custom neural network layers or loss functions for correctness and gradient computation.
# Logging and Reporting:

# Implement a more robust logging mechanism to capture and analyze failures or unexpected behavior more systematically.
