# TCS
Group project: LLM-based fuzzing

### BRIEF:

This is a project where GhatGPT is utilised to conduct fuzzing testing on the Deep Learning program PyTorch.


### TO USE: 
- Navigate to Final testing (all other files aren't used in report)
- Prefix is what LLM was used to generate the script (metaAI or ChatGpt 4o Mini)
- Suffix is what part of API is being tested:
    * Tensor Operations
    * Neural Network Functions
    * Autograd and Gradient Calculations
    * Optimization Algorithms
    * Distributed Training and Parallelism
- Download prerequisites (PyTorch, NumPy, tensorboard)
- Also need to have a GPU (to test run gpus_num.py)
- Run or alter any of the appropriate python files
