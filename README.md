# TCS Project: LLM-based fuzzing PyTorch API's

Aim: Automatically generate and mutate programs to fuzz PyTorch API's

## Using autoGenerator and autoMutator
- Create your own .env file with your personal OpenAI API key:
``` OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY ```
- Install dependencies:
``` pip install -r ./requirements.txt ```
