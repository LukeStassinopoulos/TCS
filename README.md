# TCS Project: LLM-based fuzzing PyTorch API's

Aim: Automatically generate and mutate programs to fuzz PyTorch API's

## Using autoGenerator
Create your own .env with your personal OpenAI API key:
``` OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR KEY" ```

Install python-dotenv and openai if not already installed:
``` pip install python-dotenv ```
``` pip install openai ```
