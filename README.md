# TCS
Group project: LLM-based fuzzing

- Navigate to Final testing (all other files aren't used in report)
- Prefix is what LLM was used to generate the script (metaAI or ChatGpt 4o Mini)
- Suffix is what part of API is being tested:
    - Tensor Operations
    - Neural Network Functions
    - Autograd and Gradient Calculations
    - Optimization Algorithms
    - Distributed Training and Parallelism
- Download prerequisites (PyTorch, NumPy, tensorboard)
- Also need to have a GPU (to test run gpus_num.py)
