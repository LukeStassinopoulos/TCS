1. Tensor Operations Fuzz Testing
Prompt:
Create a Python script to fuzz test a variety of tensor operations in PyTorch, including arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication), reductions (sum, mean), reshaping (view, reshape), and indexing. Use dynamic device selection to ensure all tensors are created and manipulated on the same device, either CPU or GPU. Generate random tensors with consistent shapes and data types, and ensure that any shape is passed as a tuple to avoid errors. Compare the outputs from both devices after executing operations, reporting only significant discrepancies such as NaNs or values that exceed a defined tolerance level (e.g., 1e-5). Implement try-except blocks to silently handle common errors related to dtype or shape mismatches. Always ensure that tensors are explicitly placed on the same device before performing operations.

2. Neural Network Functions Fuzz Testing
Prompt:
Develop a Python script to perform fuzz testing on various neural network components in PyTorch, including layers (Linear, Conv2d), activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid), and loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss). Ensure dynamic device selection so that both input tensors and model parameters are on the same device. Generate random input tensors of dtype float32 and ensure they are moved to the same device as the model. After passing inputs through the layers and computing the loss, compare outputs from both CPU and GPU, focusing on significant discrepancies, such as NaNs or values outside expected tolerances. Include error handling to manage dtype and shape mismatches silently, and ensure proper initialization of all components to avoid device-related errors.

3. Autograd and Gradient Calculations Fuzz Testing
Prompt:
Create a Python script that fuzz tests gradient calculations and backpropagation using torch.autograd. Use dynamic device selection to ensure that both the model and input tensors are placed on the same device. Generate random tensors and initialize a simple neural network, ensuring that all tensors are consistently placed. After a forward pass, compute gradients with loss.backward(). Move both CPU and GPU gradients to a common device before comparison, reporting only significant discrepancies such as NaNs or unexpected values outside a predefined tolerance. Implement try-except blocks to handle any dtype or shape mismatch errors silently, ensuring a robust testing process.

4. Optimization Algorithms Fuzz Testing
Prompt:
Write a Python script to fuzz test various optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSprop) in PyTorch. Use dynamic device selection to ensure that all model parameters and optimizer states are on the same device before performing optimization steps. Initialize a model and create random input tensors, ensuring they are consistently placed. After several optimization iterations, compare the updated parameters from both CPU and GPU, reporting only significant discrepancies such as NaNs or values that differ beyond a specified tolerance level. Implement error handling for dtype mismatches silently, ensuring all tensors are correctly placed on the chosen device throughout the testing process.

5. Distributed Training and Parallelism Fuzz Testing
Prompt:
Design a Python script to fuzz test distributed training capabilities in PyTorch using torch.distributed. Check for a single GPU availability and set up necessary environment variables (e.g., MASTER_ADDR, MASTER_PORT) for distributed training within the script. Use dynamic device selection to ensure that all tensors and models are placed on the correct device (CPU or GPU). After training a model using multiple processes, compare the final model parameters or outputs across devices, reporting only genuine inconsistencies or errors beyond expected tolerances. Implement error handling to manage device mismatch errors silently, ensuring all tensors are appropriately placed to avoid any runtime issues related to device identifiers. If only a single GPU is available, consider running in single-process mode for consistency.
