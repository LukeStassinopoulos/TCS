My heirachy includes folders of python scripts created by ChatGPT.
The folders merely indicate the batch of testing it was completed in.
As in each folder the same code or prompt was manipulated to achieve 
the next script(3_1 to 3_2 etc). Often taking the output into account.

Testing pt4 is where the first error was found so prompts were saved.
Testing pt5 is where prompts were tested and reworked.

Final testing includes ablation, Claude and Gpt code to be used in reports. 
These files are prefixed with gpt, claude and abl to indicate it.
All ablation tests are with gpt code.
Differential testing is also included to help find more errors.
